# DHP

A gateway/api wrapper for Discord.

## What is DHP

The goal of DHP is to provide a mostly plain wrapper over Discords APIs/gateway.
There will be no caching built in, this is for the user to implement themselves.

If you're looking for something thats easier to use, try [DiscordPHP](https://github.com/discord-php/DiscordPHP).
